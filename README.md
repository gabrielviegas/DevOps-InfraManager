# DevOps Infrastructure Management Project

## Overview
This project aims to automate infrastructure management using DevOps principles and tools. It includes provisioning virtual machines (VMs), configuring monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, deploying applications with Docker, and managing code quality with SonarQube.

## Conception
The idea stemmed from the need to streamline infrastructure setup and application deployment using automated processes. By leveraging DevOps practices, we aim to enhance reliability, scalability, and maintainability of our systems.

## Architecture
The architecture involves:
- **Virtual Machine Provisioning:** Utilizing Ansible for automating VM creation on VirtualBox.
- **Monitoring Setup:** Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
- **Containerized Deployments:** Docker and Docker Compose for deploying and managing applications.
- **Code Quality Assurance:** SonarQube for continuous inspection of code quality.

## Implementation
### Tools and Technologies
- **Virtualization:** VirtualBox
- **Automation:** Ansible for provisioning VMs
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana
- **Containerization:** Docker for application deployment
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Jenkins for pipeline automation

### Pipeline Workflow
1. **Checkout:** Fetching the latest code from the repository.
2. **VirtualBox Setup:** Installing VirtualBox for VM management.
3. **VM Creation:** Ansible playbook execution for VM creation.
4. **Prometheus Configuration:** Setting up Prometheus for metrics collection.
5. **Grafana Setup:** Configuring Grafana for monitoring dashboard.
6. **Docker Installation:** Installing Docker for containerized deployments.
7. **SonarQube Deployment:** Deploying SonarQube for code quality assessment.

## Future Enhancements
Future plans include expanding container orchestration with Kubernetes and enhancing CI/CD capabilities with more automated testing and deployment strategies.
